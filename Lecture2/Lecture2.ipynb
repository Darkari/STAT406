    "In these notes we continue looking at the problem of comparing different models based on their prediction properties. As in the previous lecture, we consider a **full** and a **reduced** model, and in all that follows we assume that the variables included in the **reduced** model were not selected using the training data. **This seemingly innocent assumption is in fact critical, and we will later come back to it.**\n",

One solution is called **K-fold CV**. We split the data into **K** folds, train the predictor on the data without a fold, and use it to predict the responses in the removed fold. We cycle through the folds, and use the average of the squared prediction errors as an estimate of the mean squared prediction error. The following script does **5-fold CV** for the `full` and `reduced` linear models on the pollution dataset, once again assuming that the reduced model was originally chosen without using the data."
