    "Hierarchical clustering.\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering refers to a class of algorithms that work in a different way from the ones we have seen so far. Both k-means and model-based clustering try to find a pre-specified number of clusters *simultaneously*. Hierarchical methods are *agglomerative*--they start with *n* clusters (one singleton cluster for each observation in the data set), and form a hierarchical sequence of clusters of sizes *n-1*, *n-2*, ..., *3*, *2*, and a final \"cluster\" composed of all the observations. The user then needs to decide where to *cut* the sequence, in other words, how many clusters to identify. Algorithms in this class are also called agglomerative, for obvious reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general algorithm can be described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Set *K = n* (the number of observations in the data), and Start with *n* clusters;\n",
    "2.  While *K &gt; 1*:\n",
    "    1.  Merge 2 clusters to form *K-1* clusters;\n",
    "    2.  Set `K = K - 1` (i.e. decrease *K* by one).\n",
    "\n",
    "The different versions (*flavours*) of this method are obtained by varying the criteria to decide which 2 clusters to merge at each run of step 2(i) above, which depends on how we measure the distance (or dissimilarity) between clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few different tools to decide how many clusters may be present in the data following a hierarchical clustering algorithm. The most commonly used is a graphical representation of the sequence of clusters, called a *dendogram*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to your class notes for details on the different merging criteria (i.e. deciding which clusters to combine at each step) and the interpretation of a dendogram. Below we will illustrate the use of these algorithms on a few examples.\n",

    "#### Breweries example\n",
    "\n",
    "Beer drinkers were asked to rate 9 breweries on 26 attributes. The attributes were, e.g., Brewery has rich tradition; or Brewery makes very good Pils beer. Relative to each attribute, the informant had to assign each brewery a score on a 6-point scale ranging from 1=not true at all to 6=very true. We read the data, and use the function `dist` to compute the pairwise *L\\_1* distances between the 9 breweries. Note that the data are available columnwise (*p* × *x*) so we first transpose it before we compute the distances. We also change the misleading column names assigned by `read.table`, which are not features but rather observation numbers:"
