    "Below we first describe the problem afflicting classical non-parametric methods (this is also known as the \"curse of dimensionality\") and then describe how to compute regression trees in `R` using the `rpart` package (although other implementations exist). Details were discussed in class.\n",

A trivial calculation shows that the expected number of observations falling between 0.25 and 0.75 will be *n/2*, in this case *50*. This is easy verified with a simple numerical experiment:"

    "So we see that if the dimension of our problem increases from *p = 1* to *p = 5*, the number of observations we need to maintain an expectation of having about 50 points in our central hypercube increases by a factor of 16 (not 5). However, if we double the dimension of the problem (to *p = 10*), in order to expect 50 observations in the central \\[0.25, 0.75\\] hypercube we need a sample of size *n = 51,200*. In other words, we doubled the dimension, but need 32 times more data (!) to *fill* the central hypercube with the same number of points. Moreover, if we doubled the dimension again (to *p = 20*) we would need over 52 million observations to have (just!) 50 in the central hypercube! Note that now we doubled the dimension again but need 1024 times more data! The number of observations needed to maintain a fixed number of observations in a region of the space grows exponentially with the dimension of the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about this problem is to ask: \"given a sample size of *n = 1000*, say, how wide / large should the central hypercube be to expect about *50* observations in it?\".

    "### Regression trees as constrained non-parametric regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees provide an alternative non-regression estimator that works well, even with many available features. As discussed in class, the basic idea is to approximate the regression function by a linear combination of \"simple\" functions (i.e. functions *h*(*x*)=*I*(*x* ∈ *A*) which equals 1 if the argument *x* belongs to the set *A*, and 0 otherwise. Each function has its own support set *A*. Furthermore, this linear combination is not estimated at once, but iteratively, and only considering a specific class of sets *A* (which ones?) As a result, the regression tree is not the *global* optimal approximation by simple functions, but a good *suboptimal* one, that can be computed very rapidly. Details were discussed in class, refer to your notes and the corresponding slides.\n",
