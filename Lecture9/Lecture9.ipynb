    "A different approach to estimating a regression function is based on recalling that the true regression function is *f(a) = E(Y | X = a)*, the mean of the response variable *Y* **conditional** to the event that the explanatory variable(s) **X** equal(s) **a**. If we had lots of data, we could, in principle, think of the following intuitively simple regression estimator: given **c**, consider all observations (Y, **X**) in your training set that have **X = c**, and take our estimated *f(c)* as the average of the corresponding observed values of the response variable Y. This would be a resonable estimator for E(Y | **X** = **c** ) (if we had sufficient cases in our training data pairs for which **X** = **c**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the simple approach above does not usually work in practice (because we do not have enough training points with **X** = **c** for many values of **c**), the idea can still be used to construct a regression estimator that works **locally**, i.e. that given **c** uses the points in the training set that have **X close to c** (you can think of this as *working in a neighbourhood* of **c**). This family of regression estimators is called *local regression*, or *kernel regression*. The latter name is based on the fact that we will use a specific family of functions (called kernels) to define which points are *neighbours* and how they will be used to estimate the regression function. Note that these *kernel functions* are different from those used in Support Vector Machines and other reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the simplest kernel regression estimator is to simply take the average of the responses of the training points where the explanatory variables are within *h* of the point of interest. This \"window width\" *h* is called the *bandwidth*. We can use the function `ksmooth` in package `KernSmooth` in `R` to do this (**but it would be a great exercise to write your own `R` function to do it**). The code below considers one specific explanatory variable for the air pollution data (just for illustration purposes) and fits a local averages regression estimator, with bandwidth equal to 50:"

A solution to this is to use *variable bandwidths*, where at each point *c* we take a bandwidth large enough to contain a pre-specified proportion *alpha* of the data. The function `loess` implements this approach, the desired proportion of observations in each neighbourhood is given by the argument `span`.\n",

As usual, information about the data can be found on its help page.\n",
