    "Model based clustering\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based clustering methods depend on a probabilistic model that specifies the distribution of the observed features (over the whole population). This distribution is typically modelled as a mixture of several different distributions. Given a sample of *n* vectors of features *X*<sub>1</sub>, *X*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *X*<sub>*n*</sub>, the clustering problem then becomes the estimation of the *n* unobserved labels that indicate to which sub-population (cluster, group) each *X*<sub>*i*</sub> belongs. In addition, one generally also has to estimate the parameters that specify the distribution of *X* in each assumed group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this method is based on a full specificification of the distribution of the observed vector of features, it is not surprising that the parameters are generally estimated using maximum likelihood. The difficulty is that there are *n* unobserved (missing) variables (the group labels) that also need to be estimated (*imputed*). The most commonly used approach uses the EM algorithm to perform maximum likelihood estimation with missing observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "EM algorithm\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The specifics of the EM algorithm were introduced and discussed in class. Although the algorithm may seem clear at first sight, it is fairly subtle, and mistakes and misunderstandings are very (**very**) common. Many applications of the EM algorithm found on-line are either wrong, or wrongly derived. For a more detailed discussion and a different (and also very useful) application of the algorithm, see the Section **Imputation via EM** below.\n",

    "Bivariate Gaussian mixture model via EM \"by hand\"\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a 2-dimensional representation of the UN votes data. This lower-dimensional representation is obtained using multidimensional scaling, a topic we will cover later in the course. For formulas and specific steps of the algorithm please refer to your class notes. We first load the data and reduce it to a 2-dimensional problem, in order to be able to plot the results. It will be a very nice exercise for the reader to re-do this analysis on the original data set."
