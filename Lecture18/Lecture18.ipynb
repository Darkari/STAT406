    "What is Adaboost doing, *really*?\n",
    "---------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the work of Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani [here](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1016218223) (see also Chapter 10 of \\[HTF09\\]), we saw in class that Adaboost can be interpreted as fitting an *additive model* in a stepwise (greedy) way, using an exponential loss. It is then easy to prove that Adaboost.M1 is computing an approximation to the *optimal classifier* G( x ) = log\\[ P( Y = 1 | X = x ) / P( Y = -1 | X = x ) \\] / 2, where *optimal* here is taken with respect to the **exponential loss** function. More specifically, Adaboost.M1 is using an additive model to approximate that function. In other words, Boosting is attempting to find functions *f*<sub>1</sub>, *f*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *f*<sub>*N*</sub> such that *G*(*x*)=âˆ‘<sub>*i*</sub>*f*<sub>*i*</sub>(*x*<sup>(*i*)</sup>), where *x*<sup>(*i*)</sup> is a sub-vector of *x* (i.e. the function *f*<sub>*i*</sub> only depends on *some* of the available features, typically a few of them: 1 or 2, say). Note that each *f*<sub>*i*</sub> generally depends on a different subset of features than the other *f*<sub>*j*</sub>'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the function the boosting algorithm is approximating (even if it does it in a greedy and suboptimal way), allows us to understand when the algorithm is expected to work well, and also when it may not work well. In particular, it provides one way to choose the complexity of the *weak lerners* used to construct the ensemble. For an example you can refer to the corresponding lab activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A more challenging example, the `email spam` data\n",
    "\n",
    "The email spam data set is a relatively classic data set containing 57 features (potentially explanatory variables) measured on 4601 email messages. The goal is to predict whether an email is *spam* or not. The 57 features are a mix of continuous and discrete variables. More information can be found at <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase>.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first load the data and randomly separate it into a training and a test set. A more thorough analysis would be to use *full* K-fold cross-validation, but given the computational complexity, I decided to leave the rest of this 3-fold CV exercise to the reader."

    "### An example with a simple neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "This example using the ISOLET data illustrates the use of simple neural networks (NNs), and also highlights some issues of which it may be important to be aware. As we discussed in class, NNs typically have more parameters than observations and a number of tuning parameters that need to be chosen by the user. Among these: the number of hidden layers, the number of units in each layer, the *activation function*, the *loss function*, a decaying factor, and the initial point at which to start the optimization iterations. In the example below we illustrate some difficulties that can be encountered when trying to find which tuning parameters to use to train a NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to focus on the concepts behind NN, we will use the `nnet` package in `R`. This package is a very simple implementation of NNs with a single hidden layer, and relies on standard optimization algorithms to train it. Such simple setting will allow us to separate implementation / optimization issues from the underlying model and ideas behind NN, which carry over naturally to more complex NNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example we will use again the ISOLET data which is available here: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ISOLET>, along with more information about it. It contains data on sound recordings of 150 speakers saying each letter of the alphabet (twice). See the original source for more details. The full data file is rather large and available in compressed form. Instead, we will read it from a private copy in plain text form I made available on Dropbox.\n",
