    "Similarly to the way we derived the LDA classifier in class, if one relaxes the assumption that the conditional distribution of the vector of features **X** in each class has the same covariance matrix (*shape*) (but still assumes that these distributions are Gaussian), then it is (again) easy to find a closed form for the conditional probability of each class (conditional on a vector of features **X**). As in the LDA case, these conditional class probabilities (aka *posterior probabilities*) depend on the parameters of the assumed model for the conditional distributions of **X** in each class. So, again, we estimate those parameters from the training set (usin the observations in each group) and plug them in to compute the conditional class probabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "With the help of an example we discussed in class the sensitivity of QDA to the assumed specific conditional distribution of the features within each class. It is very easy to see that LDA may also be affected by similar problems. This is not at all surprising--in many cases optimal methods obtained under certain conditions are very sensitive to the vailidity of the assumptions used in ther derivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to note (as discussed in class) that logistic regression was not affected by the \"good outliers\" we included in the data. Again, this is not surprising (furthermore, I expect you to be able to explain what is happening in this particular example). Note, furthermore, that both QDA (and LDA) and logistic regression are classifiers that require the estimation of parameters (maybe we can call them *parametric classifiers*?), and in all cases so far we used maximum likelihood estimates for them. However their sensitivity to this kind of outliers is very different. Discuss!\n",

We first load the data, and extract the images corresponding to digits 0, 1 and 8. These should be challenging enough to discriminate given their shape."

For a point **X** in the feature space we look at the proportion of observations in each class among **X**'s K-th closest neighbours. That is, of course, equivalent to looking at all points (*Y*<sub>*i*</sub>, **X**<sub>*i*</sub>) in the training set such that ∥**X**<sub>*i*</sub>−**X**∥ ≤ *h*<sub>*k*</sub>, where *h*<sub>*k*</sub> is the distance from **X** to the K-th closest neighbour in the training set.

    "Note how the performance of the K-NN classifier in this case stops improving when K is 10 or more.

    "Just as in the continuous regression case, when the number of available explanatory variables is moderate or large, methods like nearest neighbours quickly become unfeasible, or their performance is not satisfactory. Classification trees provide a good alternative: they are still model-free (we do not need to assume anything about the true conditional probabilities of each class for a given vector of features **X**), but they are constrained to have a fairly specifc form. Intuitively (and informally) we could say (if nobody was listening) that this restriction provides some form of regularization or penalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification trees are constructed in much the same was as regression trees. We will construct a partition of the feature space (in \"rectangular\" areas), and within each region we will predict the class to be the most common class among the training points that are in that region. It is reasonable then to try to find a partition of the feature space so that in each area there is only one class (or at least, such that one class clearly dominates the others in that region). Hence, to build a classification tree we need a quantitative measure of the homogeneity of the classes present in a node. Given such a numerical measure, we can build the tree by selecting, at each step, the optimal split in the sense of yielding the most homogeneous child leaves possible (i.e. by maximizing at each step the chosen homogeneity measure). The two most common homogeneity measures are the Gini Index and the deviance (refer to the discussion in class). Although the resulting trees are generally different depending on which loss function is used, we will later see that this difference is not critical in practice.\n",

    "As usual, in order to be able to visualize what is going on, we will illustrate the training and use of classification trees on a simple toy example. This example contains data on admissions to graduate school. There are 2 explanatory variables (GPA and GMAT scores), and the response has 3 levels: Admitted, No decision, Not admitted. The purpose here is to build a classifier to decide if a student will be admitted to graduate school based on her/his GMAT and GPA scores.\n",
